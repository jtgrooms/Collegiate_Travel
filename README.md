# Collegiate Basketball Distance Traveled and Time Rested Performance Analysis

This project seeks to identify the impact of time rested and distance traveled of the away team on college basketball performance. The code, *analysis.R* 
- Scrapes team data from basketballreference.com
- Scrapes geographic coordinates of team stadiums using ggmap
- Builds out time rested between every game for every away team for the seasons considered
- Models basketball performance metrics such as field goal percentage, turnovers, personal fouls, or win probability using logistic regression, lasso, elastic net, xgboost, and random forests
